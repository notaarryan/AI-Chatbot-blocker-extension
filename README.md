### 🚫 Block AI Chat Websites · 💪 Stay Productive · 🎓 Build Discipline

Stop wasting time on AI chat websites and stay focused!  
**AI Chatbot Blocker** helps you avoid distracting AI chat tools (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, etc.) when you need to study, work, or stay disciplined online.

Instead of sneaking back to your favorite chatbots during work or study time, this extension **blocks those websites instantly** and shows a clear message telling you to get back on track.

You can try it out on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/no-ai/gbfhceceennmlhiookakjobbmkhligia)

Learning discipline
